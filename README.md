# station-dash-dashboard
Simple dashboard to display which transfer stations are currently open.
This example can be ran on the cmd line with node.js or nw.js, the default assumes that nw.js is installed.

Navigate to the cloned directory and run nwjs on the current directory
$ nwjs .

It's also worth mentioning that the code hints or nods at category theory
with its use of functors and other FP concepts.
